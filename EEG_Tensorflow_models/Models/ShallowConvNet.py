    in Schirrmeister et. al. (2017), Human Brain Mapping.
    
    Assumes the input is a 2-second EEG signal sampled at 128Hz. Note that in 
    the original paper, they do temporal convolutions of length 25 for EEG
    data sampled at 250Hz. We instead use length 13 since the sampling rate is 
    roughly half of the 250Hz which the paper used. The pool_size and stride
    in later layers is also approximately half of what is used in the paper.
    
    Note that we use the max_norm constraint on all convolutional layers, as 
    well as the classification layer. We also change the defaults for the
    BatchNormalization layer. We used this based on a personal communication 
    with the original authors.
